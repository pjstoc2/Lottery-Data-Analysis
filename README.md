This repository consists of the .py file used for analysis, the original Excel files pulled from data.gov and Kaggle, the cleaned NUMS files which only have the relevant winning numbers and their headers, and the outputs generated by the Python script for each. They are all fairly self-explanatory with that in mind. I have organized the lotteries into their own folders for convenience. Interested parties can view my blog post about this project at https://medium.com/@paulostochaj/how-random-is-the-lottery-really-9727535db415.
